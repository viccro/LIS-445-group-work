#Outstanding questions for PREMIS 

* What are links supposed to look like?
* formatRegistry??
* In the lecture 6 examples, FIDO software is an agent, not an object. How do we know the difference?
* In the lecture 7 examples, _Version number_ is used as the objectIdentifierType on teh software...but 10.14.6 doesn't scream "Mojave OsX" to me. Is that a valid id type?
* Checksum process agent - is this not an object like the other software we've used?
* relationships are not built into the template file bidirectionally. We are supposed to do them both ways when applicable, right?
